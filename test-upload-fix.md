# Upload Fix Test Results

## âœ… **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **Problem:**
The frontend was sending `imageData` as an array in the request body:
```javascript
imageData: [
  '{"alt":"Alb color representation","isPrimary":false,"color":"Alb","isColorRepresentation":true}',
  '{"alt":"Alb product image","isPrimary":true,"color":"Alb","isColorRepresentation":false}',
  // ... more items
]
```

But the backend was looking for individual fields like `imageData[0]`, `imageData[1]`, etc.

### **Solution:**
Updated the backend to handle both formats:
1. **Array format** (what the frontend is actually sending)
2. **Individual field format** (fallback for compatibility)

### **Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Handle both array and individual field formats
let imageData = {};
if (req.body.imageData && Array.isArray(req.body.imageData) && req.body.imageData[index]) {
  // Handle array format
  imageData = JSON.parse(req.body.imageData[index]);
} else {
  // Handle individual field format
  const imageDataKey = `imageData[${index}]`;
  imageData = req.body[imageDataKey] ? JSON.parse(req.body[imageDataKey]) : {};
}
```

## ðŸ§ª **Test Instructions:**

1. **Try uploading a product again** with multiple colors and images
2. **Check the server console** - you should now see:
   - Proper color information for each image
   - Color representation images being processed correctly
   - No more "Color representation image is required" errors

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results:**

- âœ… Images should upload successfully
- âœ… Color information should be properly processed
- âœ… Color representation images should be identified correctly
- âœ… Product should be created with proper color-specific images

The fix handles the data format mismatch between frontend and backend, ensuring that color information is properly extracted and processed for each uploaded image.
