# Image Setup Instructions

## 🖼️ Hero Product Image Setup

To use your stylish woman in pale yellow pantsuit image across all products:

### 1. Image Setup ✅ COMPLETED
Your test image reference is deprecated and replaced by neutral placeholder:
```
public/images/placeholder-product.svg
```

The system is configured to use this image for all products across the site.

### 2. Image Requirements
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP recommended
- **Size**: At least 800x800px for good quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best for product images
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading

### 3. What This Will Do
Once you replace the image:
- ✅ **All products** will show this image instead of broken/placeholder images
- ✅ **Perfect for testing** the image loading fixes
- ✅ **Consistent look** across the entire site
- ✅ **No more broken images** - everything will load properly

### 4. Testing
After replacing the image:
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit any product page or the shop
3. You should see your stylish woman image everywhere!

### 5. Reverting Later
When you're ready to use real product images again:
1. Uncomment the original logic in `utils/imageUtils.ts`
2. Remove or rename the hero image file
3. Your backend images will work normally
